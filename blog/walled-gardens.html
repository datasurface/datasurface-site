            <h1>The Walled Gardens Are Back (And This Time It’s Your Data)</h1>
            <div class="meta">November 18, 2025 &bull; By Billy Newport</div>
            
            <div class="content">
                <p>Many of us are old enough to remember the "internet" of the early 90s. CompuServe, AOL, and Prodigy dominated—each a walled garden with proprietary apps, dial-up modems, and captive customers. You lived entirely within your provider’s world, isolated from users of other services except for email.</p>
                <p>That world seemed permanent. Until it wasn’t.</p>

                <h3>Then HTTP Changed Everything</h3>
                <p>HTTP and Netscape arrived and suddenly anyone could build websites on the open internet. The walled gardens, seeing the writing on the wall, grudgingly allowed their customers to use PPP—a protocol to access the broader internet through their modem banks.</p>
                <p>Within a few years, there was more content on the open web than inside all the walled gardens combined. The rest is history.</p>

                <h3>We’re Living Through This Again (But With Data)</h3>
                <p>Today's data landscape looks eerily like the 90s internet. Walled gardens run by Big Data Vendors want you to move your data into their technology and pay them to control access to it forever.</p>
                <p>Just like CompuServe customers in 1994, many companies don’t realize they’re building on someone else’s proprietary platform. When that technology inevitably changes, migrating will be very expensive or impossible.</p>
                <p><strong>I believe we’re about to enter a new data era.</strong></p>

                <h3>DataSurface: The HTTP for Data</h3>
                <p>Technologies like DataSurface will play the same role HTTP and Netscape did—connecting data producers to data consumers seamlessly while hiding all the infrastructure complexity underneath.</p>
                <p>This enables something powerful: the technology stack can evolve and improve rapidly without breaking anything that depends on it. Costs drop, performance improves, new capabilities emerge—all invisible to the users.</p>
                <p>Just as internet users today don’t care how packets traverse the network, DataSurface users won’t care how data moves from producers to consumers.</p>

                <h3>Three Types of Data Citizens</h3>
                <p>DataSurface defines a collaborative model built around three roles:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 20px 0 20px 40px; list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li><strong>Data Producers:</strong> "I have data that others need, but I want to control who uses it and for what purpose."</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Consumers:</strong> "I need data from others in a container that fits my use case. I may need the data with low latency; I need 5 year retention for regulatory requirements; I want to query the data in a transactional way/ a reporting way/ an analytical way."</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transformers:</strong> "I want to create value-added data using the right technology for my transformation."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These actors collaborate through a shared model. The model evolves over time, but DataSurface enforces strict rules ensuring model changes respect:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 20px 0 20px 40px; list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li><strong>Who can change what:</strong> Full audit trails for all model changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backwards compatibility:</strong> No breaking changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology limitations:</strong> Only use technology that is trusted for purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location requirements:</strong> Respect data residency laws/policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vendor constraints:</strong> Certain types of data are only allowed on specific vendor technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Governance boundaries:</strong> Honor organizational policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose controls:</strong> Enforce usage restrictions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The model defines <strong>what</strong> should happen. DataSurface figures out <strong>how</strong> to make it happen using the best available technology—and that technology can change over time without impacting the model’s users. Change the model and minutes later data is flowing for new use cases.</p>
                <p>No walled gardens. No lock-in. High velocity.</p>

                <h3>The Agentic AI Angle</h3>
                <p>Here’s where it gets interesting: agentic AI is being rapidly adopted across enterprises. For DataSurface, <strong>agentic AI is just another customer</strong>.</p>
                <p>By raising the abstraction level, DataSurface enables not just human actors to utilize data—it enables AI agents to consume and produce data alongside everyone else, all governed by the same rules and policies.</p>
                <p>Your AI agents become first-class data citizens, not special cases requiring custom pipelines. They are buffered from production systems, they obey the rules and policies set for them by the model.</p>

                <h3>A New Way to Think About Data Architecture</h3>
                <p>This represents a fundamental shift. Instead of building point-to-point data pipelines (the modern equivalent of CompuServe’s proprietary protocols), you define intentions in a collaborative model.</p>
                <p>Data is the lifeblood of modern enterprises. The ability to extract value from it rapidly will be a key competitive differentiator. Your data circulatory system can’t be built pipeline by pipeline — it needs to be industrialized. DataSurface enables that velocity while maintaining governance, security, and flexibility.</p>

                <h3>The Choice</h3>
                <p>You can keep building in the walled gardens, hoping your vendor stays competitive and doesn’t jack up prices once you’re locked in.</p>
                <p>Or you can build on an open protocol layer, where you control your destiny. Use best-of-breed walled gardens, but retain the freedom to shift workloads as the market evolves. <strong>DataSurface doesn’t compete with vendors—it makes them interchangeable.</strong> Deploy solutions faster today. Retrofit new vendors tomorrow. All at low cost, with no rewrites.</p>
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 30px;">
                    <strong>Stop building data pipelines.<br>
                    Use DataSurface instead.<br>
                    Build for the future, not the walled garden.</strong>
